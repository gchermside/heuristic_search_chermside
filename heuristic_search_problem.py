    Abstract base class for heuristic search problems.

    This class extends the SearchProblem class and introduces a heuristic function 
    that estimates the cost to reach the goal state from a given state.

    Methods:
        heuristic(state: State) -> float:
            Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses to provide 
            a heuristic estimate for a given state.
